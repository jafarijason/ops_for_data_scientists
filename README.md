## Who is this for?

The curriculum and some of the tips are aimed at data scientists who want an introduction to the topics of Linux & Bash. However, the data science orientation mainly comes into play in a few domain specific tips, and in the stated motivations to learn these things - if you're an aspiring web developer, there's no reason not to benefit from this guide as well!

## What is GNU?
GNU is an operating system that is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) that is, it respects users' freedom. The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages (programs specifically released by the GNU Project) as well as free software released by third parties. The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom.
<br>
We recommend [installable versions of GNU](https://www.gnu.org/distros/free-distros.html) (more precisely, GNU/Linux distributions) which are entirely free software. [More about GNU below](https://www.gnu.org/home.en.html#More-GNU).

## What is linux?

you can find simple answer [here](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux)

<ul>
    <li>
        A family of open source operating systems.
    </li>
    <li>
        Developed by Linus Torvalds, who also invented Git to manage the source code for Linux.
    </li>
    <li>
        An operating system is a program that takes over a bit after your computer turns on.
    </li>
    <li>
        For the first few seconds after your computer switches on, the motherboard runs a small
    </li>
    <li>
        hard-coded operating system called the BIOS, but it quickly hands control over to some operating system kernel, which is installed on one of the hard drives, a USB stick or CD.
    </li>
    <li>
        From that point on, the kernel decides which programs to run when, and how to control physical devices (via drivers).
    </li>
    <li>
        An operating system is a bundle of programs that come packaged together. The kernel is the most important part, but it comes with more programs which help the users communicate with the kernel.
    </li>
    <li>
        e.g. File explorers are part of the OS, but not the kernel - they're just graphical interfaces which sit between the user and the kernel.
    </li>
    <li>
        Operating systems normally also handle file systems, user permissions, memory management, and many other things.
    </li>
    <li>
        The thing that unites all the different operating systems in the Linux family is they all use the same Linux kernel - other parts differ. More on that later in the section about distributions.
